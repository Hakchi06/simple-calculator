# simple-calculator
A simple calculator made in C++ for practice.
## Project Status
Thanks to this project, I learned:
- CMake and MinGW tools for cross-compilation (Linux â†’ Windows)
- Working with FLTK in C++
- Applying the MVC architecture to a graphical user interface

The project is **incomplete**, but it is functional for basic operations (without handling signed numbers).

I decided to move forward with other projects where I could start developing from a more solid foundation and continue improving my development skills.
